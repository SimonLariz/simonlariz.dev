                        <p>
                            Hello there! I'm <strong>Simon Lariz</strong>, a
                            computer science
                            student at Cal State Fullerton. I am currently
                            pursuing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science
                            with a strong commitment to academic excellence.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a student, my days revolve around the exciting
                            world of coding, debugging, and crafting projects
                            that fuel my passion for technology. You can explore
                            a plethora of my tech ventures under the "Projects"
                            tab and on my <a
                                href="https://github.com/simonlariz"
                                target="_blank">GitHub</a>
                            page. I have an unyielding commitment to continuous
                            learning, and I find joy in breaking things to gain
                            a deeper understanding of their inner workings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Outside the realm of programming, you might catch me
                            at the gym, lifting and placing things down,
                            channeling my energy into fitness. Alternatively, I
                            immerse myself in various sounds ( currently
                            in my shoegaze phase ).
                            Chess serves as my cerebral escape, where I embrace
                            both strategizing and the humbling recognition of
                            human fallibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Drawing from my experience in Python and C++, I
                            consistently endeavor to refine my skills and expand
                            my expertise in the realm of programming.
                            Additionally, I am currently delving into web
                            development and contemplating the exploration of the
                            Rust programming language.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond my technical pursuits, my ultimate vision is
                            to utilize my skills to uplift others and make a
                            positive impact in their lives. Life is a wild ride,
                            and I'm driven to seize every moment to its fullest
                            potential.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And, yes, I enjoy a good laugh! Humor is an
                            essential ingredient in my journey, and I believe in
                            finding joy and amusement in every situation.
                            Laughter lights up the path forward, making the
                            adventure all the more worthwhile.

                    <p>
                        This website was inspired by the golden era of the 90s
                        and early 00s. I wanted to create something that drew
                        inspiration from the vibrant and colorful websites of
                        the past, delving into the captivating nostalgia of the
                        early internet - from the neon colors and funky fonts to
                        the animated gifs and tiled backgrounds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, I felt compelled to break away from the
                        cookie-cutter mold of modern personal portfolio websites
                        that often resemble more of a billboard than a genuine
                        representation of one's creativity and individuality.
                        Here, I strive to showcase my work and passions in a way
                        that resonates with my personality, rejecting the
                        conformity and embracing the quirky charm that sets me
                        apart. Through this digital playground, I hope to evoke
                        a sense of authenticity and engage visitors with a
                        unique experience that is both a nod to the past and a
                        celebration of the boundless possibilities of the
                        present.
